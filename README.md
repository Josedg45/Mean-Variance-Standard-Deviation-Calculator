# Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator

## Project Overview

This project implements a Python function `calculate()` that computes various statistical metrics (mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum) for a given 3x3 matrix. The function utilizes Numpy for efficient numerical operations and ensures that the input meets the required conditions. The project includes unit tests to verify the correctness of the implementation.

## Features

- **Input Validation**: Ensures the input list contains exactly 9 numbers, raising a `ValueError` if the condition is not met.
- **Numpy Integration**: Utilizes Numpy for efficient matrix operations and calculations.
- **Comprehensive Statistics**: Calculates mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both rows, columns, and the flattened matrix.
- **Dictionary Output**: Returns results in a structured dictionary format, making it easy to interpret and use the computed statistics.

## Installation

To set up the project locally or in a development environment like Gitpod, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
   cd your_repository
